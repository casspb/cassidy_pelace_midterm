        <h2>Diego's Spruce side</h2>

        <p>Spruce tree is the best tree because it reminds me of home. This beautiful folliage is the tree of the north. 
          Spruce are also massive, spanning 20 to 60m.</p>

          <p>They also produce pinecones and have a distinct needle like texture to their greenery. 
          It's timber is also great for building material. The timber from spruce trees are also used in piano and violins.
          That's right this tree is even used for art.
          It is even a source of vitamin C, and can be used for medicine.
          What more could you want from a tree. </p>

          <p>Spruce have 40 different kinds of species. Impressive right. The pulp from spruce is also very important to the paper industry.
          We all love Christmas, that's right spruce trees can be grown for use as Christmas trees as well.
          Spruce trees are in Minecraft. There's no willow tree in Minecraft. Makes you think.
          Spruce tree's also provide housing for animals, and keeps them warm during the winter. 
          And they also act as a source of food for deer, porcupines, elk, bear, and rabbits.
          Spruce is the tree of the soul, we love spruce.
