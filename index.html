            <p>
                Willow trees are by far top tier trees. Yes they have a shorter life span, but soak up every little bit of their lives. They use this time by being known as fast growers, and knowing the best place to grow by always being by water. They are thirsty boys and girlies, and it makes them the elite growers. Being about to grow as wide as they are tall. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They also have a phenomenal name, and are quite easily identifiable, even though they have 400 species. The leaves are shaped like tears, which gives them the name of weeping willows. 
            </p>

                They may be called weeping but they are just making sure they are close to all the good things in the world, constantly grounding themselves, and being close to the earth, water, and soaking in all the sun being wide as hell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Willow trees are where memories are made, they are the picture perfect setup, always near a pond, perfect spot for photos, picnics, frog hunting, shade, and their leaves are perfect when falling off the tree for crown and bracelet making. They are the ultimate climbing trees as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Willow trees are environmental wizards, the compound found in willow bark is similar to a traditional pain reliever, and male deers will purposely seek out willow trees when growing new antlers to alleviate the inch as the new antlers develop.  You also find willow trees in a variety of cultural expressions, whether in the arts, or in spirituality. Willow trees often appear as a symbol of death and loss, but they bring magic and mystery to people’s minds as well. Such as druids consider willow trees sacred, and for the Irish they are one of seven sacred trees. Willow trees are associated with love, fertility and young women’s right of passage.
